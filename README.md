# Data Science Portfolio by Vinatha Viswanathan

This portfolio showcases my journey in turning raw data into actionable insights. Explore a curated selection of projects—from data exploration and machine learning to domain-specific case studies—each highlighting my analytical skills and passion for solving real-world problems with data.

## Data Science - Independent Projects:

### [Personalized Investment Portfolio & Asset Recommendation System](https://github.com/VinathaViswanathan/Investment-Recommendation-System)

This dashboard empowers users to optimize their investment portfolios and receive personalized asset recommendations using machine learning. It integrates data-driven portfolio optimization, risk analytics, and collaborative filtering to suggest assets based on peer behavior and sector trends. Dynamic sidebar filters allow segmentation by number of assets, customer type, and investment capacity, ensuring tailored insights. Each recommendation is accompanied by a confidence score and clear, human-readable reasoning, making the platform both actionable and transparent.

### [Vulnerability Severity Prediction](https://github.com/VinathaViswanathan/Vulnerability-Severity-Prediction)

Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict CVSS severity scores of software vulnerabilities by leveraging both structured features (such as CWE type and access vector) and unstructured textual summaries. The project integrated and preprocessed multiple real-world datasets, applying tailored imputation methods and advanced feature engineering for categorical and text data. A Random Forest regression model, optimized with TF-IDF vectorization for text and ordinal encoding for categorical variables, was trained to deliver accurate severity predictions. The resulting system provides interpretable results and actionable insights, enabling cybersecurity teams to prioritize vulnerabilities more efficiently and manage risk proactively.


## Data Science - Learning Projects:

## 1. Classification Problems:

### [Titanic Survival Prediction with Python](https://github.com/VinathaViswanathan)

Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the classic dataset and a Random Forest classifier. Implemented robust data preprocessing steps, including missing value imputation, one-hot encoding for categorical features, feature selection, and standardization. Utilized grid search with cross-validation to optimize model hyperparameters, achieving a test accuracy of approximately 81%—demonstrating strong predictive performance on unseen data. This solution enables reliable identification of survival likelihood, supporting data-driven insights into the factors that influenced outcomes on the Titanic.

### [Credit Card Fraud Detection with Python](https://github.com/VinathaViswanathan)

Developed a robust fraud detection system using Python to identify fraudulent transactions. Implemented data preprocessing, feature scaling, and explored multiple classification algorithms, including Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Achieved strong model performance, with top algorithms reaching high accuracy and F1-scores (e.g., XGBoost and Random Forest models often exceed 99% accuracy and F1-score above 0.85 for the fraud class, depending on dataset split and tuning). This solution enables early and reliable detection of fraudulent activity, significantly reducing financial risk for credit card providers.

### [Diabetes Prediction with Python](https://github.com/VinathaViswanathan)

Built a predictive model to identify diabetes risk using the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Applied data standardization, exploratory analysis, and trained a linear SVM on medical features such as glucose, BMI, and insulin levels. Achieved a test accuracy of approximately 78% and a training accuracy of 79%, demonstrating reliable performance on unseen data. This solution enables early detection of diabetes risk, supporting proactive healthcare interventions through data-driven insights.

## 2. Regression Problems:

### [Breast Cancer Prediction Web App with Streamlit](https://github.com/VinathaViswanathan)

Developed an interactive web application using Streamlit to predict breast cancer malignancy based on cell nuclei measurements from cytology data. Implemented robust data cleaning, feature engineering, and min-max scaling, integrating a pre-trained machine learning model for real-time predictions. Enabled user-driven exploration through dynamic sliders and visualized input features using radar charts for enhanced interpretability. Achieved high predictive accuracy (commonly exceeding 95% on test data with models like Random Forest or Logistic Regression), providing instant probability estimates for benign or malignant diagnoses to assist healthcare professionals.

### [Sonar Rock VS Mine Prediction with Python](https://github.com/VinathaViswanathan)

Developed a binary classification model to distinguish between sonar signals reflected from rocks and mines using the Sonar dataset and Logistic Regression. Performed label encoding, exploratory data analysis, and trained the model on 60 numerical features representing signal energy patterns. Achieved a test accuracy of approximately 83% and a training accuracy of 86%, demonstrating the model’s effectiveness in classifying unseen sonar signals. This solution provides a reliable, data-driven approach for automated object identification, supporting safer and more efficient underwater exploration.
